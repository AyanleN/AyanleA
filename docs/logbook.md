# Logbook

*Day 1 (6/7)*:  Created a github website; there were some difficulties, but we learned by resolving the issues we had with the settings of my github account. 

*Day 2 (6/8)*: I worked on getting my bio published on my github page and editing it.

*Day 3 (6/9)* I worked on the unix shell and git lessons we had, which went quite well. 

*Day 4 (6/12)* I worked on finding the data i need for my project, and using chatgpt made it easier to find a database of genetic variation. 

*Day 5 (6/13)* I worked on finding what part of the database i need for my project, had difficulty understanding what each section served. 

*Day 6 (6/14)* Today, i worked on getting an outline of what my project would look like and worked on finding database that works for my project using google and chatgpt. 

*Day 7 (6/15)* During the meeting, I received feedback on my project, which provided valuable insights on how to improve it. I carefully analyzed the data using Python and ChatGPT, and although it took a couple of minutes to compute, I was able to derive meaningful results. Additionally, I developed a blood type finder by combining individual data with external data sources to estimate a person's blood type accurately.

*Day 8* (6/16) I attended an orientation for the majority of the day. Once it concluded, I embarked on conducting research for my project. I discovered relevant data on https://www.internationalgenome.org and proceeded to analyze how I could effectively utilize this information.

*Day 9* (6/20) I have read a couple of papers and experimented with data using ChatGPT to create a map. It was successful for some data, but I encountered challenges when attempting to incorporate all of the data into a single place. Additionally, I have been exploring and experimenting with Jupyter Notebook for my projects

*Day 10* (6/21) I spent a considerable amount of time resolving an issue I encountered on GitHub. After working through it, I successfully fixed the problem and updated my website accordingly. As part of the update, I added a section to introduce the AI, ChatGPT, that I will be utilizing for my project. Additionally, I experimented with the data I had and encountered some challenges in determining the optimal way to leverage it effectively.

*Day 11* (6/22) After addressing the issue I encountered, I gained a better understanding of the project's structure and how to optimize the use of the available data. I proceeded to separate the data I would be utilizing from the data I wouldn't. Using Python, I extracted the longitude and latitude information from the dataset. Although I faced difficulties running it on Jupyter, I proceeded to organize the data and worked on analyzing the relevant genome data for determining its relatedness.

*Day 12* (6/23) I created a map to visualize the locations of the samples. I faced some challenges while using Jupyter as I couldn't directly import a CSV file into my code to obtain the longitude and latitude of the samples. However, I found a workaround by leveraging ChatGPT to help me generate the coordinates. With the map ready, I started examining the large dataset I'll be working with to determine the relationships within the data. The dataset is quite extensive, and it may take a few days to fully analyze. Fortunately, I used ChatGPT to guide me through the process, providing step-by-step instructions that made it easier for me to understand and follow along.
