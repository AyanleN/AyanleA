# Logbook

*Day 1 (6/7)*:  Created a github website; there were some difficulties, but we learned by resolving the issues we had with the settings of my github account. 

*Day 2 (6/8): I worked on getting my bio published on my github page and editing it.

*Day 2 (6/9)* I worked on the unix shell and git lessons we had, which went quite well.
