*Day 3 (6/9)* I worked on the unix shell and git lessons we had, which went quite well. 

*Day 4 (6/12)* I worked on finding the data i need for my project, and using chatgpt made it easier to find a database of genetic variation. 

*Day 5 (6/13)* I worked on find what part of the database i need for my project, had difficulty understanding what each section serve.
