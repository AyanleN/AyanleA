# Keys Assignments 

## Assignment 1: Internship Description 
During this summer, I have been given the exciting opportunity to work in Dr. Tyson L. Swetnamâ€™s Lab at the University of Arizona. Dr. Swetnam holds the position of research associate professor of Geoinformatics and is also a Joint faculty member in the school of natural resources and environment. His involvement with CyVerse, a platform focused on data science projects and promoting open science. Currently, Dr. Swetnam is actively engaged in a project aimed at maximizing the utilization of AI in scientific research. 

#### Project Description
During my time in the lab, I will be contributing to a similar project that focuses on utilizing AI to construct a geographic map of genetic variation and the new Pangenome. The primary objective of this endeavor is to generate accessible data while simultaneously exploring how indigenous groups' data has been exploited within the scientific community.

## Assignment 2: Introduction to your Research
#### Purpose: 
The primary objective is to maximize the utilization of the data we have gathered, and one of the most effective methods is through data visualization. By visualizing the data, we aim to not only gain valuable insights but also shed light on the exploitation of indigenous data within the scientific community. 

#### Previous Research: 
A substantial body of research has been conducted on the topic, providing a wealth of data that I will utilize in creating the geographic map. One notable example of such research is the 1000 Genomes Project, which extensively analyzed genetic variations among diverse individuals to enhance our understanding of human diversity. Leveraging the data obtained from this research, I will develop a comprehensive geographic map highlighting these variations.

#### Need For Study: 
While the 1000 Genomes Project offers a substantial amount of data that I intend to leverage effectively, the question remains whether this dataset alone will be sufficient for my research project.

#### Problem Statement: 
How can AI effectively handle vast amounts of data to optimize its utilization? AI systems often face challenges when analyzing large volumes of external data. In my work, I will explore strategies to harness the power of AI to its fullest potential, allowing me to leverage its capabilities and avoid the burden of manually processing extensive datasets.
