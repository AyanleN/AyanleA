# Prompting
Prompting ChatGPT proved to be of utmost importance, as it provided the most valuable information for coding and utilizing the data I was working with. Regardless of the input character, ChatGPT made the best use of it and consistently delivered excellent responses. The only issue encountered was occasional mistakes in its output. However, by requesting corrections and finding ways to avoid repeating the same mistakes, the overall experience with ChatGPT was highly beneficial and productive.



# Google Bard

Google Bard was the least useful; the code it generated had so many issues, and overall, it didn't work the best in my experience."
