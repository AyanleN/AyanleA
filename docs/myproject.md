Problem: How diverse are humans based on regions? DNA research has predominantly focused on Europeans, potentially leading to a misrepresentation of non-European populations. This disparity raises concerns about accurately capturing genetic diversity among different ethnic groups.

Study: We investigated the human genome using a dataset of 2,504 samples from 26 populations in the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 [1]. By analyzing the principal components analysis (PCA), we aim to gain insights into the diversity within these populations and advance our understanding of human genetic variation.

Objective: Our goal was to employ large language models to analyze the 1000 Genomes dataset and generate comprehensive data showcasing the diversity based on different regions. We used ChatGPT to help write Python code to analyze genomic data. By addressing the underrepresentation of non-European populations, we aim to contribute to a more inclusive understanding of human genetic variation across diverse populations.
