Figure 1: Exploration of Genetic Diversity using Second and Third Principal Components

Figure 2: Unveiling Population-Specific Genetic Patterns: First, Second, and Third Principal Components



Despite low variance Fig 1 visually represents sample relations based on the second and third principal components. It deviates from the true results, but effectively demonstrates what the first principal component would not emphasize.
Africans and Asians (specifically, East Asians) show minimal changes prior to the first plot.
In Fig 1 South Asians collided with Europeans, but in Fig 2 they experienced a significant shift. Americans, on the other hand, showed diverse representation with varied collision patterns across regions.
These findings highlight the significance of the first principal component, which carries the majority of the variance.
