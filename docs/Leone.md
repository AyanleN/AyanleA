The Data Shows the first and third principal component while the Geo shows the relation between the second and third principal component 

Despite low variance Geo visually represents sample relations based on the second and third principal components. It deviates from the true results, but effectively demonstrates what the first principal component would not emphasize.
Africans and Asians (specifically, East Asians) show minimal changes prior to the first plot.
In Geo South Asians collided with Europeans, but in Data they experienced a significant shift. Americans, on the other hand, showed diverse representation with varied collision patterns across regions.
These findings highlight the significance of the first principal component, which carries the majority of the variance.
